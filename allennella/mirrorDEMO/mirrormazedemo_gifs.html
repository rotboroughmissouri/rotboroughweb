      '4,6': "I did not know where the man in the mirror came from. Only that he was me. I remember looking at him deep in the eyes, then looking at his face, his eyes, his hair, his lips. As I looked him up and down, I noticed this all encompassing warmth came over me. Every time I blinked, I saw a vast desert behind and around the mirror. It didn’t initially make sense to me, but by now I was too transfixed with the mirror to care. Soon its warmth felt like a maternal embrace. I hadn’t felt security like that since childhood.",
	  '4,5': "The more I blinked the more clear the visage of the desert became. Eventually I could feel the hot air, the sun’s burning heat, and the sand at my toes. Soon several forms came into my view, palm trees, huts, and soon people. Eventually this vision was all I could see and it was then I noticed I was surrounded by people. For some reason all I could move was my eyes…",
	  '4,5,W': "Hmmm this looks familiar… WAIT, UP AHEAD THAT’S THE ENTRANCE! Let’s try this again!",
	  '5,5': "Months must have passed before I took another step. I just sat in this maternal warmth and did not move. My joints made an audible crack as I began to move again. They had grown just as comfortable as I have in their positions. I turned my head to face the villagers. They took a cautious step away from me but soon returned to their original positions and just stared at me.",
	  '5,4': "The other members of the village soon poured out to see me. They looked at me, and then at the mirror. They had asked me if I knew what it was. I told them yes, and they looked at me as if I was the oracle of the world. They asked me what it was called. I told them it was a mirror. It was just like the one in my room. They were mesmerized.",
	  '6,4': "One of the village children walked up to the mirror and said that me and the mirror were like new best friends, brought up from the ground to be with them. I didn’t think much of these words beyond them being a cute thing for a child to say, but I would soon only have these words to remember him by.",
	  '6,3': "I don’t recall how many of us went to bed that night, but what I do know is that by morning only five of us remained. The boy was among the missing. The area which once occupied the single mirror now was a hallway of mirrors. No one moved or said anything to each other the rest of the day. The sun had not moved at all. I remember thinking how strange that was but before I could think too deeply on it I had heard the voice of the boy coming from the hall of mirrors.",
	  '6,2': "All at once, the five of us stood up and rushed toward the door of the hallway. The door would not move. ",
	  '6,1': "The sun had started to set… It had distracted me entirely from the sound of his little voice. I sat down on the ground and looked up at the sky.",
	  '5,1,W': "I must have fallen asleep without realizing as I only remember the sun setting and then rising once more. I looked back at the hallway and it had now more corridors. One stretching east, another west. It continued like this for some time as one by one until a new hallway, corner or doorway was formed. In 3 days time it was just me and the village scribe.",
	  '5,2,S': "I woke up, and met with him on the penultimate day and we had a friendly chat. He told me why he became a scribe - to impress his father - and what he wrote. We both understood that even though this was more of a mutual eulogy rather than a conversation it went on as if we had been friends for years.",
	  '4,2': "He asked me if all mirrors did this to everyone, I looked at him woefully as I noticed tears began to pool in his eyes, and it was then I remembered it was his son who had vanished all those days ago.",
	  '3,2': "I couldn’t find the strength to answer him. These were the last words I heard anyone speak. The next morning he was gone. And come the morning, the door to the hallway was opened.",
	  //'3,3': "I spent my last day, walking through what was now the maze of mirrors yelling out in anguish to whatever force was responsible for taking all these people away. I asked what or who gave the mirror the right to do this. But no matter what question I asked I heard nothing. I began beating my palms against the mirror until bruises began to form and blood began pouring from my hands. I began to cry and fall to my knees. I was laying down sobbing when the echo of the boy’s voice. It caught me by surprise, I didn’t even recognize it at first. I had to sit for a moment and recollect where I had heard it before, while I was remembering I noticed I had been moving toward the sound. It led me to the corner of the maze to an open door… In the mirror was my bedroom… I took one step toward it… and down I fell… I wondered where I was going until suddenly darkness overtook my eyes. I had no voice, I could not feel anything, I could not hear anything. Why is this happening to me…",
	  '3,6': "The more I blinked the more clear the image became. It overcame my vision entirely. What I once thought was a desert quickly revealed itself to be my room. I was looking at myself. I watched as the phone rang, just like before. I was seeing what just happened. I didn’t know what to think.",
	  '2,6': "I leaned against the mirror, but as I took a step toward it, I kicked the mirror with my foot, and I watched myself turn around to face the mirror…",
	  '2,5,N': "But soon this mirage managed to slip away, and I found myself standing before a great hall of mirrors. Hundreds, thousands maybe. I once again found myself unable to move. “What is going on?” I thought. I only had two answers, turn left or right and find out.",
	  '1,5': "I followed my heart...",
	  '3,5,E': "I turned right… The more I blinked the more clear the image became. It overcame my vision entirely. What I once thought was a desert quickly revealed itself to be my room. I was looking at myself. I watched as the phone rang, just like before. I was seeing what just happened. I didn’t know what to think. ",
	  '3,5,S': "Okay, I have been here before! Now let's see…",
	  '2,6': "I leaned against the mirror, but as I took a step toward it, I kicked the mirror with my foot, and I watched myself turn around to face the mirror… ",
	  '2,5': "But soon this mirage managed to slip away, and I found myself standing before a great hall of mirrors. Hundreds, thousands maybe. I once again found myself unable to move. “What is going on?” I thought. I only had two answers, turn left or right and find out.",
	  '3,4,N': "Another fork in the path of mirrors… I heard a strange sound… Like music coming from the right, it sounded vaguely familiar. It filled my body with a warmth like before, but it was dull. From the left, a cacophony of whispers, I could just barely make out what they were saying. I thought I heard “Closer” but I wasn’t sure. Which way..?",
	  '3,4,W': "Hmmm, yeah this place is definitely familiar. I could hear music up ahead. It filled my body with warmth like before, but it was dull. From the left, a cacophony of whispers, I could just barely make out what they were saying. I thought I heard “Closer” but I wasn’t sure. Ahead seemed equally as familiar as the last place I was. I sat and wondered… Which way..?",
	  '4,4,E': "I turned right again, and as soon as I laid my foot upon the floor, the song soon became a triumphant choir of voices. My entire body went cold, and I stood in place for a few seconds. I took a breath and prepared myself to move again. The choir was now an entire army of voices singing, their volume had not raised but the closer I got the more beautiful the arrangement became. My head felt light, but not as if I was about to pass out, but like I was dreaming. It only grew and grew in complexity the closer I got, I fell to my knees and cried at how beautiful it was. I couldn’t even believe what I was hearing. ",
	  '4,3,N': "It was like the sounds of nature took the form of singing voices, one a booming thunder. I turned and voices like the sound of rain. It was then I noticed from my left the sound of two men speaking.",
	  '4,4,S': "I moved on, I was standing in one of the corner hallways of the maze when I realized I had been here before.",
	  '4,3,W': "When I woke I was no longer in the desert but I was stuck in the middle of the maze. I looked around me to see where I could go next. It was then the echoes of memories I hadn’t even made yet took over my mind and I started to see glimpses and visions of things that felt familiar. I wasn’t sure what happened and what didn’t. What I did know was that I had to keep moving.",
	  '5,3,E': "I thought about whether to join him or to keep moving forward. He was talking to someone I think about himself. I recall hearing the word “scribe” but not understanding what it meant at the time.",
	  '5,3,S': "We spent the day going through his belongings and his house. We both knew by the next morning one of us would be gone…",
	  '5,2': "I was approaching another fork in the road, to my left It sounded like me and someone else. I was talking with him like we had been friends forever. I listened to him talk about his son and I appeared to be greatly upset by his story - tragic as it was - but it was as if I knew something he didn’t. Ahead of me however was more of these strange and alluring sounds… ",
	  '5,1,N': "Some like the rumble of the earth. It was overwhelming. To my left was a reverberating echo and a door that was slightly open. To my right was a corner that only seemed to bring me closer to the source of the beautiful music…",
	  '6,1,E': "The music now filled my entire body. I was spellbound by the beauty of each note. I noticed I was no longer walking but rather “dancing” toward the music being strung along mindlessly as if I had lost my autonomy. All I knew was to keep following the music.",
	  '6,2,S': "On I went… Now breaking into twirls and side steps and letting the music take full control of me. The warmth I once felt burnt like a fever, and the only way to cool down was to continue moving and dancing through the halls.",
	  '6,3,S': "The influence of the music now had a death grip on my body and I was now atavistically shaking my arms and body around but then as I stepped forward…",
	  '6,4,S': "Another fork in the road, by now I had almost lost full control of my body, but the right hand path did catch my eye. But ahead was the source of the music. I danced for a while until I decided what to do.",
	  '6,5': "I stepped forward only to find the beautiful music had subsided. It reached its climax with an echoing hum that sounded like it came from every direction. I sat and tried to remember what it sounded like but the incessant humming had clouded my memory, and I was nearly deaf from the ringing it put in my ears. The sound became so intolerable I decided to step forward.",
	  '6,6': "All this seemed to stop as I heard a door open… in this moment everything culminated in all my senses. I could see, I could hear, I could feel, I could taste, I could smell. Every sense was on overdrive, the pleasure was possessive, but something was missing…",
	  //'5,6,W': "I stepped forward. Finally, the peace I had been yearning for, the release I had been waiting for. I felt as if I was flying through the door and into space and everything became true again… I had become me. Everything made so much sense now, Heaven and earth were mine… I had been made in heaven, I had ACHIEVED HEAVEN. I had been placed back within the lost firmament. I had regained truth, I had gained ME.",
	  '5,4,W': "Without realizing I spun and stepped to the right and as soon as this happened the music stopped. I stood and looked around. Wait, have I been here before? Uh… Wait. Yea this place does look familiar… Wait where am I???",
	  '5,5,S': "Okay, I shouldn’t panic. I feel as though I’ve been here before. I’m not sure why I feel that way but maybe I can find my way back if I just…",
	  '4,1': "I walked through the door only to be faced with the beginning of the maze. This time however, I turned right… Or, was it left? Huh, I can’t seem to remember where to go… I decided to turn around but there was now a wall in front of me… I tried to retrace my steps. *You are forever lost within the walls of the maze.*",
	  '2,4': "Wow, even more decisions to make… before me 2 paths. The music and the visions seemed to have subsided. Now this deafening silence overcame me. I was almost too afraid to move. I had to make a choice. ",
	  '1,4': "I decided to go forward and noticed I began to clench my fist and gnash my teeth. My hand was bound so tightly I was almost shocked I didn’t notice it before. It felt right for some reason.",
	  '1,3': "My hand was so tight now, my nails began cutting into my palms and blood began to leak from in between my fingers. I stopped for a second to look at the blood. I began to lap up my own blood. It filled me with IMMENSE satisfaction. I needed more. I sat for a while and studied the flavor of my own blood. It was oddly sweet. I wondered if the blood of others tasted as good as my own.",
	  '1,2': "I took another step forward but my hunger became almost intolerable. And the pain in my palms was making it hard to enjoy the pleasures of my blood. I looked ahead to one of the mirrors and saw myself surrounded by people. They appeared to be villagers in a desert. I stared at them. I began to lick my lips with anticipation.I stepped through the mirror and found myself in the village at night. I was so excited I was shivering, an old man saw me behind one of the huts and smiled at me. I smiled at him and he smiled back and walked up to me and began talking about the mirror.",
	  //'1,1,N': "I was too focused on the taste of his blood to even hear what he was saying and as he turned to grab something that fell out of his hand I beat him over the head with a nearby rock. I hadn’t noticed he had a sword on his side until now. I stared at it and smiled wide. Somehow no one else seemed to be woken up by the commotion. I withdrew the sword and cut his arm and tasted his blood. It was even sweeter than my own. I was so absorbed in the taste of his blood I carelessly took a bite of his flesh and it was even more delicious than his blood. And it was then I realized… I have an entire village of samples to take. All of them are asleep. My smile was so big it hurt. I stepped into each hut and massacred almost all of them. I thought the sun was starting to rise by the time I snapped out of this. But it was the mirror opening as if it was a door. It beckoned me to put each of the bodies into it. I did what it said. As I finished putting the last body into the mirror I saw myself. What looked back at me was someone different. But by this point it didn’t matter. I had blood to take, and a mirror to feed. When I was finished I stepped back into the mirror. And I waited to consume the rest of them…",
	  '2,3': "I stepped forward. At this point the isolation in this maze began to overtake me. I was growing increasingly paranoid. Where was this doubt coming from? I feel as though I have been waiting for this moment my whole life. Why was I so afraid now…",
	  '2,2': "I took another step forward but this dread only seemed to get stronger. I noticed I wasn’t the one moving myself forward. It was the mirror. I tried my best to turn back but I couldn’t stop moving.",
	  '2,1': "By this time I remembered something I read in my book before I entered this maze. And it helped me calm down. It said: “A river does not cut through stone with force, but through persistence. A river of force destroys and loses more than a river in flow.” With these words in mind I decided having come this far now, my only option was to embrace what would happen.",

		Aries: "He spoke but I heard nothing of it, my mouth was yammering for his warm blood, and the sound of his voice was lost beneath the pulse of my own hunger. He bent to gather something he’d dropped and I lifted a stone from the sand and broke it against his skull. The stone sang in my hand. I saw then a sword at his side, sheathed and idle, and I took it for my own as if it had always belonged to me. I held it to the light and saw my face in it and I did not know the face. I cut him open. His arm opened like fruit and the blood came and I drank of it and it was sweeter than any wine I’d known. I set upon him again, with my teeth now, and I tore a piece of him and I chewed and swallowed and was made strong by it. There was no sound but the rasp of breath and the dark murmuring of the trees and still the village slept. I rose and made my way from hut to hut. They lay curled in their blankets like offerings. I killed them where they slept. A slaughter done in silence. The blade did not tire and neither did I. My smile split my face and still it grew. I was drunk with it, rapturous, gone. The sky had begun to pale and I thought the dawn was coming but it was not the sun that rose it was the mirror. It opened in the dark like the maw of a beast and bade me feed it. I dragged the bodies one by one and laid them in its throat. When the last was taken I looked upon the glass and it showed me a thing not myself and yet it was me. Changed. Complete. There was nothing left to do. I stepped into the mirror and passed beyond it. And there in that stillness I waited. I waited for the rest of them…",

His skull made a satisfying crack as it crumbled from my strike. It sent lightning up my fingers. The flint I grabbed was that sharp, I nearly cleaved his skull to the thrapple. “Oh wow.” I said to myself. Surprised at the vomit of gore before and all over me. This pleasure was phenomenal. I bent to sample my latest kill and was moved by the sweetness of his blood. I quickly realized I had an entire village that would meet its end by my hands. I happily obliged myself by going from hut to hut. Killing women and men where they lie in their cots, silently like a curse of biblical reckoning. I was so soaked in their blood, I was dyed red. As I was concluding my hunt I turned to face the mirror who’s voice by this point became impossible to ignore. I saw myself in it. I was painted red and black and sprinkled with miscellaneous sinew and flesh. I had nothing to say. I just stared at myself for a while. And then I looked at the now mountain of corpses before me. I greeted them with a sigh, but it was one that was accompanied by a job well done. And a job well done indeed. I looked to the east. Very low and very small came to sunrise on the meridian of the horizon. I took ample time loading the bodies into the mirror. I had left only a few due to my lack of time. But I wasn’t finished just yet. Soon they would all be mine.",
		Gemini: "He began babbling about nothing when I noticed he had a sword on his hip. Ever curious, I asked him if I could look at it. He was more than obliging, the poor fool. And once I held it in my hands I cocked my arms back and lobbed his head clean off of his body. He languished and bent forward, falling as if he was dumb and without understanding as small strings of arterial blood spilled from out of his neck. It then began to bubble and hiss until eventually he gave way and it emptied out of him. I then cupped my hand around his neck and took small sips of his blood. It was surprisingly bitter. Curious still no one was awakened by the sound of his slaughter. I wondered how many more I could taste… I decided to put this to the test. Sword in hand, I went through each hut, picking each of them off. I had almost gotten all of them when I noticed the sun had begun to rise to my back. It was at this point the mirror began to whisper to me. It beckoned for me to bring the bodies to it. I did so carefully until the final remnant of my campaign was inside the mirror. Realizing I had a handful left I decided to hide until morning and wait to get the rest of them.",

He hemmed and hawed but to no avail his fate in my arms was sealed. I was now the only thing standing between him and cosmic oblivion. I turned my body to the left with my arms around his neck and a loud crack echoed from him as he went limp. He did not ever move again. He let out a low whisper of a howl and I threw him off of me and I looked at what I had done. Somehow no one else seemed to be woken up by the commotion. I withdrew the sword and cut his arm and tasted his blood. It was even sweeter than my own. I was so absorbed in the taste of his blood and painted my face with it. “Yes…” I whispered to myself. I turned to face the rest of the huts and realized I had more to tend to. Each hut, each scream, each death — it was like my own private joy. All of them are asleep. My smile was so big it hurt. I stepped into each hut and massacred almost all of them. I thought the sun was starting to rise by the time I snapped out of this. But it was the mirror opening as if it was a door. It beckoned me to put each of the bodies into it. I did what it said. As I finished putting the last body into the mirror I saw myself. What looked back at me was someone different. But by this point it didn’t matter. I had blood to take, and a mirror to feed. When I was finished I stepped back into the mirror. And I waited to consume the rest of them…",
		Virgo: "I hadn’t even heard what he said, and before I knew it he was headless and lying over before me. I must have grabbed the sword he had on him and cut his head off without realizing. The swiftness was that great it was almost imperceptible. I looked into the blade and what looked back at me was no longer the me that stepped into the mirror, but a relentless and precise predator. I thought about what I was going to do next. I decided to carve his arm as if it were fruit and methodically drink the blood that spilled from it like an animal at a river basin. The taste was phenomenal. I, with care, spent a good deal of time doing so. Until I looked beyond him to the other huts and tents before me. I looked at them dumbly and began to walk as if possessed to each one slaughtering their inhabitants with machine-like precision. Not a sound or resistance from each of them. Their deaths served as the completion of a personal rite of passage. I finished almost every last one of them when I turned to face the mirror now glowing like the Sun. It asked me to bring the corpses of the villagers to it for oblation. I did what I was told. And it told me that my patience would be rewarded on my next hunt. I thought about what this meant for a while as I realized the others I had left would be up soon. I quickly found a place to hide until night time and waited with the mirror's words in my head. “Patience…” I said to myself… Over and over again. “Patience.”",
		Libra: "I was too focused on the taste of his blood to hear his words. When he turned to pick up what he'd dropped, I brought a rock crashing down on his head. Only then did I notice the sword at his side. I drew it, admiring the weight, and slashed his arm. His blood, sweeter than my own, flooded my mouth. I was lost in it, so much so that I tore into his flesh without thinking. It was divine. That’s when it hit me. An entire village lay asleep. My smile stretched wide. This wasn't a slaughter. This was balance. Justice. One by one, I stepped into each hut and delivered judgment. What I thought was the sun rising wasn’t, it was the mirror, creaking open like a door, calling me. It told me to offer the bodies, and I obeyed. When the last was fed to the mirror, I saw myself. Different. Complete. Justified. I had blood to take. A mirror to feed. And when I was done, I stepped through it content to wait until the rest were ready to face what they owed.",
		Scorpio: "I didn’t hear a word he said. The taste of his blood drowned out everything else. When he bent to retrieve what had slipped from his hand, I brought a rock down on his skull fast, unthinking, but necessary. Only then did I notice the sword at his side. I stared at it, wide-eyed, breathless. As if it had been meant for me all along. No one heard me. The world was still, holding space for what I was becoming. I drew the sword, carved into his arm, and tasted him again. His blood was richer than mine. It was complex, alive, a scripture written in warmth. I was overcome, and before I realized it, I’d bitten into his flesh. It was ecstasy. Not pleasure, but revelation. The hunger had turned holy. I felt it in my marrow. It was a compulsion beyond control, like molting into something new. There were others. Sleeping. Unaware. Waiting to be part of what I was becoming. Grinning until my face ached, I entered each hut. I moved as if possessed, methodical and intimate. This wasn’t massacre, it was metamorphosis. With every body, I shed more of who I had been. By the time the mirror opened like a door, I thought it was morning. But no. It was my altar shining like the Sun. It called for the bodies, and I answered. I stacked them with reverence, proof of devotion. Evidence of change. When the last one passed through, I saw my reflection. Not a stranger. Not a monster. But the shape of what I’d always been underneath. I had no name for it. Only the knowledge that I was not finished. There was still blood to take. Still offerings to make. So I stepped into the mirror and waited, patient and trembling, for the next unveiling.",
		Sagittarius: "I didn’t hear what he was saying. My attention was caught elsewhere in the warmth of his blood, the silent confession it offered. When he turned to retrieve something he had dropped, I brought a rock down on his skull. Simple. Inevitably simple. Only then did I notice the sword at his side. I regarded it not as a weapon, but as a key. I unsheathed it and made a cut along his arm. His blood touched my tongue thick with something ancient, something like memory. It was knowledge in liquid form, a language I didn’t yet understand. Sweeter than mine, yes but deeper too. In my absorption, I bit into his flesh. I expected guilt. I found wonder. And then the question emerged: How many other truths sleep in warm bodies, waiting to be known? The village lay still. The night held its breath. I moved from door to door, not as a butcher, but as a seeker. Each life ended with quiet deliberation. Each body, a text I had only begun to read. I thought dawn was coming when I looked up again. But it was the mirror, a door, a mouth, a judgment. It opened without sound, inviting me to return my findings. I obeyed. I stacked the bodies with care, as if constructing a question no one else had dared to ask. When the last body disappeared, I saw myself. Changed, certainly. But also revealed. The reflection stared not with malice, but clarity. I no longer needed answers. I needed blood. I had purpose. And the mirror still hungered. So I stepped through. And I waited not out of need, but out of patience. There would always be more.",
		Capricorn: "I barely heard what he was saying. His blood had my full attention. He turned to pick up something he had dropped, and I struck his skull with a nearby rock. Only then did I notice the sword at his side. I stared, calculating. No one else stirred. I drew the blade, made a clean incision along his arm, and tasted him. Sweeter than expected. Promising. I sampled a bite of flesh—richer than the blood. This was more than indulgence. This was potential. And then I understood: the village was asleep. Unaware. Vulnerable. Ripe. I moved from hut to hut, methodical and unwavering. Not rage, but resolve. I wasn’t killing. I was collecting. By the time the mirror opened, I thought it was dawn. But it was purposely taking shape. It welcomed each body, and I obliged. I stacked them with discipline, like bricks in a foundation for something greater. When the final offering vanished into the glass, I saw myself. Sharper. Harder. Aligned with the path I was forging. The mirror would open again. There were still many more. I had time. I had will. I would not stop.",
		Aquarius: "I barely registered his voice. I was focused on the blood. When he turned to retrieve something he had dropped, I brought a rock down on his skull. Only then did I see the sword at his side. A tool. An opportunity. I studied it, curious what signals might race through his nerves if I carved with precision. No one stirred from the noise. It was perfect. I drew the blade across his arm, and tasted him. His blood was complex, refined, better than mine. That’s when the realization crystallized: the village was asleep, a living archive of specimens waiting to satisfy my palate. Smiling, I moved from hut to hut. Silent, deliberate, efficient. Like a demonic force Each body is a data point. Each scream, a fleeting variable. I worked until the mirror opened. Not a reflection, but a gate. It welcomed the bodies. I understood. When the last one passed through, I looked at the figure staring back at me. Altered. Aligned. I had become what I needed to be. The rest of them were still out there. The mirror would open again. And I would be ready, curious, patient, exacting.",
		Pisces: "I never heard what he had said. If I did it had completely slipped my mind. All that occupied my mind was his blood. I pretended to listen for a little bit when he bent to grab something and I cleaved his skull with a rock. He swayed and buckled forward under his own weight. He fell so quietly to the ground it was like he weighed nothing. I made an audible noise as I pondered this. I wondered if any of this was real, or if I was real. I noticed by now he had a shortsword at his waist and I grabbed it and studied its blade. It shone like the mirror, and I took a few moments to look at myself. My eyes were different. They were empty. I initially didn’t even recognize myself. I didn’t have time to think about that now. I was still hungry. I bent down and split his arm open and sampled his blood. It was oddly sweet, and left an electric feeling in my mouth. I left him there for now and looked beyond to the village at large and realized I had many more at my disposal. I carefully walked from hut to hut with care and slaughtered each of them in turn. I was shocked at how quickly I managed to do so. Each of them offered not the slightest resistance to their fate. Some even seemed to offer themselves up to me. I felt as if I was dreaming. Like this was my mind shaping reality around my most hidden and primal desire. I stood in the center of the village and noticed there wasn’t so much as a drop of blood on the sand. I turned to face what I thought was the rising sun but ended up being the mirror shining brilliantly. I thought for a moment that the mirror was calling me to it. It wanted me to bring the bodies of the dead to it and to leave them inside of it. I put the first body into it and a hallway appeared. Each body I put into the mirror seemed to extend the hallway forward. By the time I was finished the sun had begun to rise and I realized I had a few left to give unto the mirror. So I hid until nightfall for my next kill.",

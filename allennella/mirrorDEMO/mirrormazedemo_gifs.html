	  '3,6': "Every part of my body was flush with my Love. This love, once a whisper, soon became an uproarious chorus of warmth and inner peace.",
	  '2,6': "It wasn't long before all external needs; namely my hunger, my thirst and my need to blink, soon became a thing of the past. Soon I no longer even needed to breathe.",
	  '2,5': "After shedding these trivialities it was then when what became apparent. Yet here I stood looking at the floor like a child, longing for my mother.",
	  '3,5': "Months must have passed before I took another step. I just sat in this maternal warmth and did not move, My joints almost snapped as I walked forward.",
	  '3,4': "They had grown just as comfortable as I have in their positions. With each crack of their animation I looked forward and saw what I believed to be a village and I took my rest there. Until…",
	  '4,4': "In the morning I found the mirror from my room had been in the sand before me. I don’t know how it got there, but I remember that it shined like the sun.",
	  '4,3': "The other members of the village came to face the mirror. They had asked me if I knew what it was. I told them yes, and they looked at me as if I was the oracle of the world.",
	  '5,3': "They asked me what it was called. I told them it was a mirror and just like when I initially stepped into it, they were mesmerized.",
	  '5,2': "One of the village children walked up to the mirror and said that the mirror was like a new best friend, brought up from the ground to be with us.",
	  '5,1': "While I initially thought these words were cute, I would soon only have these words to remember him by.",
	  '6,1': "I don’t recall how many of us went to bed that night, but what I do know is that by morning only five of us remained. The boy was among the missing.",
	  '6,2': "The area which once occupied the single mirror now was a hallway of mirrors. No one moved or said anything to each other the rest of the day. The sun had not moved at all.",
	  '6,3': "I remember thinking how strange that was but before I could think too deeply on it I had heard the voice of the boy coming from the hall of mirrors.",
	  '6,4': "In 3 days time it was just me and the village scribe. I woke up, and met with him on the penultimate day and we had a friendly chat.",
	  '6,5': "He asked me if mirrors did this to everyone. I looked at him woefully when I noticed tears began to pool in his eyes, and it was then I remembered it was his son who had vanished.",
	  '6,6': "The next morning he was gone. And come the morning, the door to the hallway was opened. I spent my last day, walking through what was now the maze of mirrors yelling out in anguish. I began to cry and fall to my knees. I was laying down sobbing when the echo of the boy’s voice. It led me to the corner of the maze to an open door… In the mirror was my bedroom… I took one step toward it… and down I fell…",
